# JavaScript
###### JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
