# A growth mindset
## fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. 
## This concept struck a chord with me because I discovered that when I try things,
I often get only so far before encountering
a challenge and stopping. 
## I have similar troubles with cycling. When my alarm goes off at 5 A.M., the thought of going out on the bike is dreadful. The temptation to stay in bed is strong, strong, strong – curse you, instant gratification monkey –
but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset.
