## fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. 
## This concept struck a chord with me because I discovered that when I try things,

but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset.
