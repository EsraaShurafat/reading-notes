### This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

### A complete and detailed list of operators and expressions is also available in the reference.

## Operators
### JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- Assignment operators  
- Comparison operators  
- Arithmetic operators  
- Bitwise operators  
- Logical operators  
- String operators    
- Conditional (ternary) operator  
### Logical operators
#### Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value. The logical.

## Loops and iteration
> for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
