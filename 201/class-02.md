# HTML Structure
![html](https://www.jaimebutler.ch/jb-edit/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Basic-HTML.png)
- HTML pages are text documents.  
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled Xbrackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.  
- Tags are often referred to as elements.  
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes Xthe start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more Xabout the content of that element. 
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are Xavailable for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

### How do I add a script for a web page?
- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 
- The HTML script element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file rather like the link element can be used to load a CSS file. 


- If you view the source code of the page in  the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created. 

### Adding js :
```
<script>
let username="sami"
</script>

or 
<script src="app.js">
</script>


```   




## JavaScript Loops 
#### Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
#### Kinds of Loops :
- for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.  




```
The for loop has the following syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

The while loop has the following syntax:

while (condition) {
  code block to be executed
}


```
