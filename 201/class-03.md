# HTML list :
![list](https://www.techfry.com/images/articles/html/html-lists.jpg)
- Ordered lists : are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- Unordered lists : are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
- Definition lists lists : are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
### nested Lists 
##### You can put a second list inside an li element to create a sub-list or nested list.

- Controlling size of boxes
- model for borders, margin and padding 
- Displaying and hiding boxes
#### At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
#### limiting WiDth
- min-width 
- max-width
#### overflow
##### The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
#### hidden
#### This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
#### scrollThis
####  property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
 - Border : Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
 - Margin : Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
 - Padding : Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
 ### Basic JavaScript Instructions

 #### SHORTHAND FOR CREATING VARIABLES
 1. Variables are declared and values assigned in the same statement. 
 2. Three variables are declared on the same line, then values assigned to each. 
 3. Two variables are declared and assigned values on the same line. Then one is declared and assigned a value on the next line.
 #### The JavaScript Switch Statement
 - Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
 #### This is how it works:
- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- If there is no match, the default code block is executed.
