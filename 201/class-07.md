# HTML Tables 
![tables](https://www.techfry.com/images/articles/html/html-tables.jpg)
### A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

- The table tag element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the tr tag element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells Xrepresented by the td element (or th if it is a header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row Xor column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a thead, tbody, and tfoot.

# WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?
### Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in  that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 
1. BROWSER OBJECT MODEL 
2. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL 
3. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS
## GLOBAL O BJECTS: MATH OBJECT
### The Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. 
## Summary :
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).

## Domain Modeling
### Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
## Summary:
- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
