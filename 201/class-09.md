- Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.
- Why Forms? The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage.
## Form Controls
- Adding text
- Making Choices
- Submting forms
- uploding files
## Form structure 
1. form
2. action
3. method

- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a form element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

# HTML Lists

- In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

# Events Js

- When you browse the web, your browser registers different types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, " Hey, this just happened." Your script can then respond to these events. 

- HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE? 
1. Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to
2. Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response. 
3. State the code you want to run when the event occurs. 


## JavaScript Events
### HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

## examples of HTML events:
1. An HTML web page has finished loading
2. An HTML input field was changed
3. An HTML button was clicked

```
<element event='some JavaScript'>
```



- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. 
- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. 
- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element. 
- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in  the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
