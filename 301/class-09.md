## What is functional programming?
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- A pure function is a function which: Given the same input, always returns the same output. Produces no side effects.
## What are the benefits of a pure function?
- Pure functions are much easier to read and reason about. All relevant inputs and dependencies are provided as parameters, so no effects are observed that alter variables outside of the set of inputs. This means that we can quickly understand a function and its dependencies, just by reading the function's declaration.
## What is immutability?
- Informing the compiler about the immutability of the variable allows for optimizing the code and logic behind the implementation of the code.
## What is Referential transparency?
- are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value (and vice-versa) without changing the program's behavior. This requires that the expression be pure, that is to say the expression value must be the same for the same inputs and its evaluation must have no side effects.

## What is a module?
-  is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.
## What does the word ‘require’ do?
- statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object.
## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
- by using class and import
## What do we have to do to make a module available?
- The core modules include path, file system, os, util, and a few others. Third-party modules: Third-party modules are the external Node modules. These are the third-party Node modules developed by Node developers that are made available through the Node ecosystem
