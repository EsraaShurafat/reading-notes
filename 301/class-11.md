## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
- If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.
## Give a real world example.
- Now, what are the main database user groups? Patients should be able to access the database using a Web browser to order prescriptions and make appointments.
## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- So, if your application requires high availability and scalability, a NoSQL Database built on BASE properties might be suitable. Choose NoSQL if you have or need: Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema. Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns
## Give a real world example.
- NoSQL is used for Big data and real-time web apps. For example, companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google collect terabytes of user data every single day. NoSQL database stands for “Not Only SQL” or “Not SQL.” Though a better term would be “NoREL”, NoSQL caught on
## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.
## Which type of database is best for scalability?
- The clear winner with over 1/3 of multiple database type use is the combination of MySQL and MongoDB. While MongoDB is often considered an alternative to MySQL, the two databases do work well together when properly designed. The second most popular combination was MySQL and PostgreSQL together.

## What does SQL stand for?
- SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.
## What is a realational database?
- is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.
## What is a ‘schema’?
- is an abstract design that represents the storage of your data in a database. It describes both the organization of data and the relationships between tables in a given database. Developers plan a database schema in advance so they know what components are necessary and how they will connect to each other.
## What is a NoSQL database?
- are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
## Howo does it work?
- data allow Node.js to function without the impedance mismatch and data conversion. For instance, if you're using Rails, you would convert from JSON
## What is inside of a Mongo database?
- MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.
## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
- Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
