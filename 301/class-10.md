## [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)
## What is a ‘call’?
- The call allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object. call provides a new value of this to the function/method. With call , you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object

## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
-twice 

## What does LIFO mean?
- Certain data structures like Stacks and other variants of Stacks use LIFO approach for processing data.

## Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
## What causes a Stack Overflow?
- The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

## What is a ‘refrence error’?
- An #REF error (the “ref” stands for reference) is the message Excel displays when a formula references a cell that no longer exists, usually caused by deleting cells that a formula is referring to.
## What is a ‘syntax error’?
- In computer science, a syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in compile-time.
## What is a ‘range error’?
- Description. A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String.
## What is a ‘tyep error’?
- The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function; or.
## What is a breakpoint?
- In software development, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes.
## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
- Debuggers allow users to halt the execution of the program, examine the values of variables, step execution of the program line by line, and set breakpoints on lines or specific functions that, when hit, will halt execution of the program at that spot.
